<h1>Essay on Tiger | Tiger Essay for Students and Children in English</h1>
<p>Essay on Tiger: The tiger is a majestic animal that dawns on the forests of the world. The tiger is found in many
    locations across India and is often threatened by the presence of poachers who hunt them down. The reason for
    killing tigers lies in human greed and belief. The Chinese often make medicines out of the nails and other portions.
    The skin
    is sold off at enormous prices. Despite its might and strength, this makes the tiger be one of the most vulnerable
    creatures
    of the forest. There are, however, laws related to the caring and protection of such species in India and across the
    world.</p>

<p>The tiger is an exceptionally beautiful creature that is full of might and vigor. It is found in India mainly in the
    northern and central parts. This includes the jungles of Rajasthan, such as Sariska national park. In central India,
    tigers are found in the national parks of Kanha and Bandhavgarh. They can also be located at the foothills of the
    Himalayas in Neora Valley in West Bengal as well as other designated places that have been provided with a robust
    architecture of security. The West Bengal in the Eastern part of India has a considerable number of tigers in the
    Gangetic delta region of the Sunderbans. The Sundarbans are an exquisite piece of mangrove forests that are
    separated
    by a river running between them. The nature of the landscape over there is such that the forests extend into
    Bangladesh.></p>
<p>hese forests are home to a variety of flora and fauna, which includes the Royal Bengal Tiger. However, as much as
    terrific, it sounds, for those who live in the Sunderbans, life is a daunting experience. And they owe it solely
    to the tiger. Reports of tiger attacks are not uncommon in parts of India where forests and living spaces are in
    close conjunction. When it gets old or when it fails to find any food material to the woods, a tiger often
    resorts to such living areas for food and turns into a man-eater.</p>
<p>Such tales about man-eaters have been documented by the famous hunter Jim Corbett, whose name is another
    national park in Central India. Corbett was known for his hunting skills during the British period and is
    often respected among many village communities today for taking down man-eaters. While tigers risk mankind
    in one way, the larger argument here is that mankind risks the living of such creatures in a more
    substantial way. The rate at which forests are cleared for development projects, the spread of
    eco-tourism, and the frequency of forest safaris tend to disturb the natural habitat of the tiger.
    This causes it to venture into a human territory for food.</p>
<p>A decade ago, the total estimate of the number of living tigers in the whole world was abysmally low
    due to weak regulation, lack of protection, and the advent of poaching. However, the coming up of
    environmental concerns and the need to maintain the balance of the food chain efforts have been made
    to increase the number of tigers in the entire world systematically. This has been possible due to
    increased environmental regulation and environmental activism on various animal rights groups. Also,
    there has been a significant increase in the quantum of punishment across countries on poaching
    charges.</p>
<p>The sale of animal byproducts like skins hides and nails has also been enacted to be wholly
    illegal, and anyone caught in the act thus commits a punishable offense. The most exciting
    feature about tigers is their ability to swim, especially the Royal Bengal Tiger. It has a unique
    f understanding the flow of the water and current in the tides before it jumps into the water for
    a swim. This goes to show that the tiger is not just beautiful and majestic but creative and
    intelligent too.</p>

<p>The tiger is one of the animals children look forward to when they are visiting the zoo.
    Children are often attracted to the tiger as an animal because of the stories they hear about
    ifthese stories are often about hunters like famous kings and princes who used to hunt down tigers
    as a favorite pastime. Often they used to keep the heads and skins of such tigers as trophies, which
    are well preserved as of today.</p>
<p>Tiger is a unique and majestic creature. They often become victims of poaching and other
    illegal activities that have often threatened their existence. Nevertheless, with
    missions like Project Tiger, it has been possible to increase awareness among people and
    ensure an increase in the number of tigers through several different approaches,
    including stricter laws and the creation of national parks. National parks, especially
    the core areas, are the best place to spot tigers during summer. we will soonly update
